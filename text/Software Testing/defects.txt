# The Defect Lifecycle:
<ol>
<li>Discovery: Tester Discovers the issue.</li>
<li>Reporting: Tester Reports the issue to the Project Management team</li>
<li>Priority/Triage/Assignment: PM team assigns priority and dedicates someone to work on the issue</li>
<li>Resolution: The Dev fixes the issue (could be 5min, could be 5 months)</li>
<li>Verification The Tester checks that the issue has been resolved, and if so, closes the issue</li>
</ol>
<br>
The lifecycle isn't necessarily linear, 
<br>
So the Tester may (in Verification) discover that the issue is not resolved, 
<br>
And the dev needs to fix it again - this could continue indefinitely, but should require PM approval every time.

## How does the Tester Report this issue? What info should they give?
Different teams, tools and businesses have their own ways - and you should follow those,
<br>
But this is a general guideline to make "reporting the issue" as helpful as possible to the dev - and to yourself when you need to verify that the fix is right:
<ol>
<li>Summary: A very basic overview of the issue - like "system crashes when user logs in".</li>
<li>Description: A more detailed description of the issue - could also include some of the test data you used, or a link to the testcase</li>
<li>Reproduction Steps: Very important! Tells the reader exactly which steps you took to produce the error  - so that they (and you, later, at verification stage) can see if the bug is resolved</li>
<li>Expected Behaviours: How the system should've behaved</li>
<li>Observed Behaviours: How the system actually behaved</li>
<li>Impact: What is the impact of this issue? (client can't log in, system is inoperable, etc.)</li>
<li>Severity: Blocker, Normal, Minor, Critical, Enhancement, etc. -> in most cases, these will have different meaning for different teams</li>
<li>Workarounds: Steps the user can take to "get around" the issue and still use the system.</li>
<li>Notes: Basically anything else you want to add, like test-cases, system info, error messages, screenshots, the Client-version number, etc.</li>
</ol>
