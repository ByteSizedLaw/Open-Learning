# Hidden Incompetence:
This occurs when we attribute positive qualities or expertise to an individual or organization based on a single positive trait (Like their reputation).
<br>
It's essentially a [halo-effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect), where their 1 good trait eclipses or hides all their bad traits, thereby making us completely blind to them.
<br>
For example; If someone is physically attractive, we subconsciously attribute Kindness and Compassion to them, despite an upfront lack of evidence to support those attributes, or direct evidence to support the contrary.
<br>
If someone is mean, rude or direct (without regard for social cues) we naturally assume that they're Leaders, or very intelligent.
<br>
This [cognitive-bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) makes us believe that they are better than they actually are, just because of a single positive trait. It makes us assume things that aren't necessarily true.
<br>
Hidden incompetence is exactly the same as a halo-effect. People are shielded from being "outed as incompetent" by the reputation, status or <b>assumed</b> experience/skill they hold.
<br>
You'll usually see that most management or Senior staff will be 50+ years old, this is because of the <b> assumed </b> expertise that they've developed over the years, which has properly equipped them for the job. This is just an assumption though, and doesn't guarantee that they are as skilled as others believe them to be.
<br>
We assumed this solely from their advanced age, alone.
<br>

## Hidden Incompetence: Organizations
Think about a Commercial Bank, and you can't help but think about all the cutting-edge, military grade, super-technologies it implements and the workforce of ONLY the world's greatest minds it employs.
<br>
Yet, in reality, banks are some of the least-secure organizations who frequently outsource development to contractors whose credentials aren't verified, who have access to source code and your data (making it easy for them to share with hackers -> making attacks like [this one](https://www.bankvault.com/the-swift-hack-why-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-bank-heists-makes-a-good-case-for-bankvault/) or [this one](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6ppv06e3n8o) possible).
<br>
Most banks also run off COBOL, which was written in the 1960s and no longer has support (Unlike Java, Python, C#, etc.). 
<br>
COBOL is infamous for its "legacy"/Ancient/Prehistoric status. Because this is a legacy language, there aren't many COBOL developers around, so many core banking systems will be locked-in (without future improvements) in a few years.
<br>
To summarize, most banks are not as cutting-edge as we'd like to imagine. We just attribute that to them, because they have lots of money.

## Hidden Incompetence: Employees
Similarly, as with our Bank and Age examples from earlier, the same applies to employees of massive corporations - like Microsoft or Apple. 
<br>
Employees from Apple are surely the best-of-the-best and the brighest minds around, right? 
<br>
Not necessarily.. we just assumed that, because Apple's <b>reputation</b> as being a Tech-Giant with only the best cutting-edge, world-class Tech, hides employee shortcomings and what happens behind closed-doors.
<br>
We attribute to all Apple employees that "they are the best, because they work for Apple, and a world-class organization like Apple will only hire the best". This assumption is completely untrue, because there's no evidence to support it.
<br>
In this vein, an incompetent employee within Apple is now being shielded by "Hidden Incompetence", simply because they work for Apple, so they must be the best, and won't be questioned or tested.
<br>
In their interactions with vendors or other IT professionals, they will feel superior and better, because they come from an organization with more renown - despite the fact that they may actually be the least technically-skilled in the interaction.
