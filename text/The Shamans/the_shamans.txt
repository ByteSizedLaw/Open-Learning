## The "Shamans": Guardians of Esoteric Knowledge or Barriers to Growth?
In the vast, ever-changing universe of IT, technology is often perceived as a mystical force—complex, awe-inspiring, and enigmatic. With fields as diverse as web development and cybersecurity, each governed by its own unique languages, frameworks, and rules, it is no wonder that business leaders often feel overwhelmed by its intricacy. As the pace of technological innovation accelerates, many have chosen to step back, entrusting the reins to intermediaries who can bridge the chasm between their ambitions and the elusive world of IT.
<br>
These intermediaries—the technologists—often emerge as modern-day "mediums," translating lofty visions into tangible realities. Their skillset can seem magical: the ability to conjure solutions for frustrating problems, navigate oceans of syntax, and transform startup dreams into engines of wealth. To those outside the realm of IT, technologists appear to wield a unique form of power, one worthy of admiration and even reverence.
<br>
But what happens when reverence evolves into romanticization? When technologists begin to believe they alone possess the wisdom and authority to navigate this domain? Enter the "Shaman"—a technologist who perceives their expertise not as a shared resource but as sacred knowledge, reserved for an elite few.
<br>
## The Shaman Persona
Shamans position themselves as gatekeepers, guarding the "spirit realm" of technology with fierce exclusivity. They are not content to simply bridge the gap between ambition and execution; instead, they hoard knowledge, keeping others at bay to maintain their perceived superiority. Their egos thrive on the mystique of their role, convincing them—and often others—that they alone can wield the arcane arts of technomancy.
<br>
This mindset manifests in several ways. Shamans scrutinize their colleagues relentlessly, creating tension and discouraging growth. They play office politics to sour opinions of others, casting themselves as the ultimate experts while refusing to take on the responsibilities that true leadership entails. For them, clout is the end goal, and they seek it by undermining and outshining those around them.
<br>
Shamans demand perfection from their peers, fostering a culture where mistakes—the very building blocks of growth—are met with disdain rather than understanding. Their superiority complex compels them to offer unsolicited opinions on every topic while hoarding the practical knowledge others seek to learn. This not only stifles innovation but leads to unhealthy dependencies on the Shaman’s expertise.
<br>
## The Toxic Ripple Effect
For managers — whether SDMs or PMs — Shamans pose a unique challenge. Their behavior undermines teamwork and collaboration, creating an environment where fear outweighs curiosity. Staff members hesitate to innovate or even learn, fearing judgment or public humiliation. This culture of fear erodes morale, leading talented individuals to leave, often taking their invaluable skills and experience with them.
<br>
Left unchecked, Shamans can manipulate coding standards and Ways of Working (WoW) to suit their own agendas, weaponizing processes to attack others while exempting themselves from the rules. Their ego-driven behavior disrupts team dynamics and project timelines, replacing camaraderie with competition and cooperation with conflict.
<br>
Some leaders mistakenly view conflict and competition as beneficial, believing it keeps teams motivated. However, when Shamans are involved, this dynamic shifts from healthy rivalry to toxic division, where team members aim not to excel but to eliminate one another. The results are devastating: reduced collaboration, diminished morale, and a culture that punishes growth rather than fostering it.
<br>
## How Shamans Are Created
The Shaman persona is often born from over-romanticization. For some technologists, the allure of being seen as a modern wizard evolves into delusion, fueled by excessive praise and the mystification of their field by non-techies. Fear of seeming uninformed prevents many from questioning or challenging Shamans, further cementing their status as gatekeepers.
<br>
For non-technical staff overwhelmed by technology’s complexity, it is essential to remember that IT—like any field—is a human creation, crafted for human benefit. No topic is too complex to be understood, and no knowledge should remain locked behind walls of exclusivity. Learning and curiosity are vital components of growth, and no one should feel intimidated or unworthy of exploring the world of technology.

## A Call to Action
As SDMs, PMs, and leaders, it is your responsibility to dismantle the barriers Shamans construct. Encourage transparency and knowledge-sharing within your teams, empowering every member to learn and grow without fear. Recognize the danger of key-person dependencies and take steps to ensure no single individual holds undue power over your projects or your people.
<br>
Shamans may resist efforts to demystify their knowledge, clinging to the illusion of their exclusivity. But as a leader, your focus must remain on the collective good—fostering a culture of collaboration, inclusivity, and openness. When everyone is empowered to contribute, the results transcend individual egos and elevate the entire team.
<br>
In the end, technology is not magic. It is a tool—a profound, remarkable tool—but one designed by humans, for humans. Its mastery is not reserved for a select few. It is a journey of learning and growth, accessible to all who are willing to embark on it.
<br>
Together, we can break the cycle of gatekeeping, ego-driven behaviors, and toxic dynamics, ensuring that every voice is heard, every idea valued, and every individual empowered to thrive.
