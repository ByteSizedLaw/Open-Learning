# The "Shamans"
In the modern IT realm, there exists complex technologies and frameworks - plus acronyms up-the-wazoo! 
<br>
There are different fields and specializations, from web-dev to cyber-security and so on, each with their own technologies, terms, frameworks, rules, etc., and they're all always changing!
<br>
So, over time, as IT became commonplace in any business, businessmen acknowledged that there is simply too much for any 1 person to master, too much to remember, too much to deal with, when they already have so much to do, and that things are becoming obsolete at an alarming rate, while new tech takes the stage and turns business on its head.
<br>
Because of this everchanging landscape, businesspeople simply shut themselves away from this wondrous-world of tech, and instead, employed Mediums (People that communicate for you [usually with spirits]) to communicate their desires with the "spirits of technology", and turn ambitious ideas into money-making engines.
<br>
<i>Who are these mediums?</i> They're the IT staff, of course!
<br>
These wonderful magicians are able to turn problems (like "my printer won't work"; "I can't run this app"; "This app isn't working") into solutions with nothing but the <b>POWER OF THEIR MINDS!!!</b>
<br>
They also know all the magic keywords - the Spells (Language Syntax) - to turn abstract ideas into reality. They possess the magic to turn a Start-Up's ambitious hopes and dreams into phenomenal wealth.
<br>
<br>
Because of these romanticizations, it's easy to see why people still think about technology and technologists in this way.
<br>
People believe that "tech" is this profound, deep and magical thing that only a select-few geniuses understand, or could ever master. They go completely silent when a techie speaks, and they're too afraid to "speak IT" in the techie's presence in fear of looking dumb.
<br>
Techies/Technologists (Software devs, engineers, etc.) go even further with the romanticizations - because they feel like <b>actual Wizards</b>, wielding this incomprehensible magic that mere mortals could not begin to grasp.
<br> 
Techies who fall into this trap of romanticizing tech - because it makes their lives interesting and makes them feel smarter - become what I call "Shamans". 
<br>
<br>
<i>Ok, so we've said all of this, and we still haven't explained what a Shaman is?</i>
<br>
Well, A "Shaman" is a techie who believes that they're an actual Shaman -> someone who belongs to a <b>VERY SELECT FEW</b> who understand the magical and mystical <b>esoteric</b> arts of Technomancy.
<br> 
This <b>CHOSEN ONE</b> believes that ONLY they can understand or wield tech, and therefore (This is very important) <i><b>only they should ever be allowed to</b></i>.
<br> 
<br> 
They are Mediums for you to communicate with technology, but also <b>GateKeepers</b>, that will prevent ANYONE except their chosen-few to enter into this forbidden "spirit realm", because only they have <i>authority</i> to do so.
<br>
Shamans genuinely believe that they are the smartest minds in any room they enter, and that they don't need to work in teams, or get input from anyone (let alone a disgusting non-techie -> ewww) because they are the absolute best-of-the-best, the pinnacle of human evolution. 
<br>
They usually also refuse to "surrender" a topic they feel expert-at to any peers. Basically, they will outright refuse to believe anyone else has any knowledge or skill in an area they feel expert at, because they dont want anyone else 'stealing their thunder'.
<br>
<br>
This is dangerous for you as an SDM or PM, because they will either do the absolute bare-minimum to help other team members, or they will outright refuse to. This includes helping <i>you</i>!
<br>
This is even worse as a PM/SDM, when you've got complex issues to explain to <i>your</i> bosses, but the Shaman refuses to explain the actual issue to you, or uses verbose jargon to muddle your already-muddy picture of the problem.
<br>
Even worse than that, they could sabotage entire projects and actively "work others out" by creating toxic environments (Grouping up with other Shamans and targetting the "outcasts" of wizard society) to remove any other staff they feel threatened by. 
<br>
This acts to the detriment of the business, because you're losing good staff, simply because of a Shaman's ego.
<br>
<br>
Shamans are incredibly dangerous for ANY team (In any industry) and for any project.
<br>
<br>
Strike them down when and where they appear.


# Traits that Shamans have:
<i>Note: You'll find that Shamans are close to my definition of "Hero-Devs" (This is still under construction), because they essentially are, and share lots of the same traits. It's possibly to be both a Shaman and a Hero-Dev.</i>
<ul>
    <li>
        Guard esoteric knowledge:
        <ul>
            <li>Like a dragon guarding it's gold, they guard the areas they feel expert at.</li>
	    <li>They outright invalidate others' skills/opinions because they believe that ONLY they are allowed to know something.</li>
            <li>This could manifest in arguments, behind-the-scenes gossip - where they turn team members against "outcasts", or in blatant refusal to "surrender the area of expertise", or acknowledge that others are right, or capable of doing something.</li>
            <li>Basically, they'll act as GateKeepers for anything they feel that only they should know.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Selfishness:
        <ul>
            <li>They don't go out of their way to help others</li>
            <li>They usually won't interfere with something unless it benefits them in some way, like by making them look smart or charming to the larger group</li>
	    <li>They usually won't share knowledge with other team members, and will always say the bare-minimum when handing-over work to someone else</li>
            <li>They usually fill Knowledge-sharing sessions with reasons for why they're experts, or why you should trust them on a certain topic, rather than actual information that will teach anyone anything -> this is usually to stall until the session ends and they can go back to being cool and mysterious.</li>
            <li>You may also find that Shamans are Jacks-of-all-Trades and Masters-of-All, who have years of experience with {this} and they've expertly done {that} a million times -> until there's a major code-red issue, then they're nowhere to be seen.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Isolated/Reclusive:
        <ul>
            <li>They don't want to be PART of the team, they want to BE the team</li>
	    <li>Basically, they will prefer to do work on their own, without interacting with others - partially because they don't want others to "steal their thunder" or to learn their secret, ancient techniques, but also, because they truly believe that they're the only ones capable of doing the work.</li>
            <li>This is terrible for PMs/SDMs, especially in the more modern Agile methodologies of Software Dev, because you cant have a Shaman show up, grab a piece of work and disappear into the mountains for a few weeks, then re-emerge once they've hit some kind of issue, or they've written bad code that's too late into the project to change or fix.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Superiority:
        <ul>
            <li>Only they are allowed to know things, so they will outright attack others that enter their domain of expertise.</li>
	    <li>This may manifest in their refusal to let someone else perform a task (like uploading code to GitHub, for example), because they truly believe that only they should be allowed to, because they are "the only one who knows what they're doing".</li>
            <li>Shamans place themselves on a golden pedestal, and always have some expert opinion to share. You'll usually find that - especially in conversations of tech or languages - they've basically built everything under the sun, by themselves. There's always some other company they've used {this} at, and they've worked with {that} before. They will outright refuse to admit that they don't know something, and if they're ever outed, they will persist that they are experts (This is usually where the conflict with other staff comes in, and Shamans start to divide the team).
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


# Are all Shamans bad?
Yes, even if they're productive by working on their own, it's not good for the team or business to have a Shaman in your midst.
<br>
Some managers believe that it's good to have conflict and competitiveness in the team because it keeps everyone on their toes, this is fine - if Shamans aren't involved. 
<br>
Once Shamans get involved, the culture changes completely, and "healthy competition" becomes "do or die", where team members are actively trying to "work each other out". 
<br>
This culture doesn't foster growth or learning, it punishes it.
<br>
It's especially bad for the business when people no longer want to work with Shamans, and they leave - because you lose actual experts to keep <i>self-assumed experts</i> and their egos happy.
