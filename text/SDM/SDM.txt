# Software Development Management (SDM):
A Software Dev Manager (SDM) plays a crucial role in Software Dev teams and large-scale projects. You can find them "spear-heading" major projects in various industries - from Game Dev to Finance.
<br>
SDMs are usually permanent employees (so the role is rarely outsourced) and act as "generalists" in their specific fields - this is contradictory to the Hierarchical Bias that most people have towards managers.

## Hierarchical Bias:
Organizational hierarchies often place managers at the top, leading to the assumption that they possess superior knowledge or skills to those below them. 
<br>
However, expertise isn’t solely determined by position or number of years in a position.
<br>
<br>
Thinking about it differently, if you had to ask Elon Musk what time backups {for a specific twitter server} runs, 
<br>
He wouldn't be able to tell you, because he's the CEO, not the guy doing the actual backup work. 
<br>
<br>
Basically, <b>workers</b> (the lowest of the organizational hierarchy) <b>are the most skilled</b>. 
<br>
Workers are experts at their jobs and in their fields. They usually only ever work in a single position or industry for their entire careers, because they are "specialists".
<br>
<br>
Managers are "generalists", because they aren't experts and don't have the best technical skills/knowledge, but they have a general understanding of what happens. 
<br>
They usually switch between positions and industries throughout their careers, because their skills aren't specialized to a specific field or industry (unlike "Web Devs" or "Mobile App Devs", who specialize in a single field).
<br>
<br>
As you go up the organizational hierarchy, the more "generalist" people become -> basically, the less they know about "how exactly" the company works or produces value.


## Why does the SDM role exist?:
<ol>
<li> <b>Communication Bridge</b>: SDMs facilitate communication between Technical and non-Technical business stakeholders. They translate complex tech jargon into business terms for execs. This ensures everyone is on the same page.</li>
<li> <b>Business Alignment</b>: SDMs align software development efforts with the overall business strategy. They ensure that projects contribute to the company’s objectives.</li>
<li> <b>Resource Management</b>: SDMs allocate resources. They balance workloads, assign tasks, and manage budgets. By optimizing resource utilization, they enhance productivity and reduce bottlenecks.</li>
<li> <b>Project Risk Mitigation</b>: SDMs address technical challenges, anticipate roadblocks, and create contingency plans in a proactive approach to minimize Project disruptions</li>
</ol>
<br>
Basically, SDMs work very closely with the Project Manager to ensure that projects are completed on time, and are accountable, firstly for when projects aren't completed (or budgets evaporate), and secondly, when there are world-ending events like Cyber attacks, or systems have gone down, etc.
<br>
Where the PM focuses specifically on the project and what work needs to be done, the SDM manages who actually does that work and how they work with others to complete the project.

## What does an SDM actually do?
<ol>
<li> <b>Team Coordination</b>: SDMs organize daily stand-up meetings, ensuring everyone is aligned on project status, goals, and blockers. They address team concerns and facilitate collaboration.</li>
<li> <b>Assist with Project Planning</b>: SDMs help to maintain project plans. They help the PM define milestones, allocate resources, and track progress</li>
<li> <b>Stakeholder Communication</b>: SDMs interact with product managers, business owners, and other business stakeholders. They communicate project updates, manage expectations, and address any issues that arise.</li>
<li> <b>Resource Allocation</b>: SDMs allocate work based on team members’ strengths and availability</li>
<li> <b>Performance Reviews</b>: SDMs conduct regular performance evaluations for their team. They provide feedback, set goals, and identify areas for growth</li>
<li> <b>Assist with Long-Term Planning</b>: SDMs assist the Product Manager/Owner with planning team growth, identifying technology trends, and business goals, etc.</li>
</ol>

## Misconceptions about SDMs:
<ol>
<li> <b>"SDMs Are The Best-of-the-Best"</b>: Contrary to this belief, SDMs are usually the <b>least technically-skilled people</b> on the team. Their role is more about orchestrating resources, aligning projects with business goals, and fostering collaboration</li>
<li> <b>"SDMs Are Just Paper-Pushers"</b>: While administrative tasks are part of the job, SDMs do much more. They shape team culture, drive innovation, and ensure projects ultimately succeed. Administrative work is just one aspect of their jobs.</li>
<li> <b>"SDMs Are Always Serious"</b>: Effective SDMs balance seriousness with approachability. They build rapport with their team, listen actively, and create a positive work environment. Humor and empathy are essential.</li>
</ol>
Note that the first point covers technical skill. Ultimately, you can still find work as an SDM, even if you've never been a programmer before, because the job doesn't require intense technical-skill. Generally, those studying in the fields of HR or an MBA will become PMs or SDMs over time.

## SDMs aren't Tech-Leads:
Yes, the final-decision is always up to them because they're ultimately the-most-responsible for the team and project, 
<br>
But SDMs are also the <b>least technically-skilled people on the team</b> so there are usually experts that make all the Tech/Language recommendations for them.
<br>
These experts are the Senior Engineer (SE), AKA Tech-Lead or Team-Lead.
<br>
<br>
Every project consists of 3 key-people, these are:
<ol>
<li><b>PM</b>: Responsible for the project's success. They manage <i>what</i> work is done, and <i>when</i> it's done by.</li>
<li><b>SDM</b>: Responsible for the project's success. They manage <i>who</i> does the work, and <i>how</i> they work with others to get the Project done. Basically, they manage the People, Relationships and Culture</li>
<li><b>Tech-Lead</b>: Responsible for the project's success. They make all the <i>recommendations</i> of what Tech or Languages are used and often <i>work</i> as a sounding-board to managers and workers alike.</li>
</ol>
This sounds like <i>"An SDM could be a Tech-Lead though"</I>, but they are completely different roles, with different areas of focus and importance.
<br>
It's also important to note that all 3 are <i>"Responsible for the project's success"</i>, this means that all 3 could be fired simultaneously if an important project is botched.
<br>
Usually, because of this threat, SDMs will <i>"stay in their lane"</i> and allow Tech-Leads and PMs to excel in theirs, to ensure that projects are successful.
<br>
In the scope of larger and more important projects, it's difficult and dangerous for SDMs to wear-too-many-hats, so they employ the help of a trusted Tech-Lead to run with all the tech-based decisions for them.

## Traits of a good SDM:
Every person is different - and there's no way of knowing how someone will act in a specific scenario until you see them in that scenario, but "<b>the good SDM</b>" usually has the following characteristics:
<ol>
<li> <b>Leadership Skills</b>: SDMs inspire and guide their teams. They set a positive example, foster collaboration, and motivate team members towards business goals</li>
<li> <b>Clear Communication</b>: Effective communication is crucial. SDMs articulate expectations, provide feedback, and ensure everyone understands project objectives</li>
<li> <b>Empathy</b>: SDMs understand their teams’ needs, challenges, and aspirations. They create a supportive environment and actively listen to concerns.</li>
<li> <b>Conflict Resolution</b>: SDMs handle conflicts constructively. They mediate disagreements, promote understanding, and maintain a positive team dynamic</li>
<li> <b>Decision-Making</b>: SDMs make informed choices, considering both technical feasibility and business impact. Decisiveness is essential for an SDM</li>
<li> <b>Delegation</b>: SDMs empower team members by delegating tasks appropriately. They trust their team’s expertise and avoid micromanagement</li>
<li> <b>Results-Oriented</b>: SDMs focus on outcomes. They track progress, celebrate achievements, and address obstacles promptly</li>
<li> <b>Active Listening</b>: Approachable SDMs actively listen. They pay attention, ask follow-up questions, and validate others’ perspectives. This shows empathy and respect</li>
<li> <b>Availability</b>: Being accessible matters. Approachable SDMs respond promptly to messages, attend meetings, and make time for one-on-one discussions</li>
<li> <b>Non-Judgmental Attitude</b>: Approachable SDMs don’t judge or criticize. They encourage creativity and reasonable risk-taking without fear of retribution</li>
<li> <b>Feedback Receptivity</b>: SDMs who welcome feedback — both positive and constructive — create a culture of continuous improvement. They appreciate input from all team members</li>
<li> <b>Approachable Body Language</b>: Even in virtual settings, body-language matters. They maintain eye contact, nod, and show interest during conversations to make others feel welcome to participate</li>
</ol>

## Downsides of being an SDM:
<ol>
    <li>
        Finding work:
        <ul>
            <li>SDMs are hard to replace, so <b>keeping work is super easy</b>, but it's a double-edged sword because they are also hard to replace, so other companies aren't replacing them often - so <b>finding work is super hard</b>.</li>
            <li>This contrasts the "worker" or Developer, because Devs are always being hired and fired, making work extremely easy for them to find, because companies are constantly on the lookout for new ones.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        People Management Challenges:
        <ul>
            <li>Managing people involves handling conflicts, addressing employee performance issues, and ensuring team morale. It’s rewarding but can also be emotionally draining, and may (in some rare cases) result in you becoming a target for threats, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Stressful Deadlines:
        <ul>
            <li>Meeting project deadlines, especially during crunch times, can be stressful. SDMs must manage expectations while maintaining quality.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Decision-Making Pressure:
        <ul>
            <li>SDMs make critical decisions that impact projects and entire careers. The weight of these decisions can be stressful, or even dangerous (in the case of disgruntled and violent ex-employees)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Poor leadership is hilariously hard to spot!:
        <ul>
            <li>Poor Leadership is often accompanied by so many other (seemingly random) issues, that it's often only realized AFTER an entire team (including the SDM) has been fired and replaced.</li>
            <li>As a Leader, it's actually very hard for you to know if you're doing a good job, because Poor Leadership is so incredibly difficult to detect.</li>
            <li>It's easy to know when a Dev/BA/Tester are underperforming, but how do you know if you (as the SDM) are doing poorly?</li>
            <li>To those only logging in to make money, this isn't a concern at all, because it means that keeping your job is ultra-easy, even if you do poorly or have no clue what you're doing -> but to the SDMs that want to improve themselves, this is a pretty crucial existential crisis.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>



## Conclusion:
Being an SDM can be super rewarding, but it balances out by being super challenging as well.
<br>
By being one of those things that are hard to measure accurately - and differs for every team - you have your work cut out for you, when trying to lead teams to success.
<br>
<br>
Remember, that as the SDM, you are the least skilled, least knowledgeable person in your team. 
<br>
"Your" workers are the experts and should be taken seriously and treated with due respect. Without your team, it will be impossible to achieve anything.
<br>
<br>
Ultimately, Leaders - more than anyone - need to be "team players", and shouldn't rest on their titles/laurels, or allow their egos to go unchecked.
