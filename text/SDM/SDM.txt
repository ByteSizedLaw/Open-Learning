# Software Development Management (SDM):
An SDM plays a crucial role in software development teams and large-scale projects. You can find them "spearheading" major projects in various industries - from Game Dev to Finance.
<br>
SDMs are usually permanent employees (so the role is rarely outsourced) and act as "generalists" in their specific fields - this is contradictory to the Hierarchical Bias that most people have towards managers.

## Hierarchical Bias:
Organizational hierarchies often place managers at the top, leading to the assumption that they possess superior knowledge or skills. 
<br>
However, expertise isn’t solely determined by position or experience in a "generalist" position.
<br>
Thinking about it differently, if you had to ask Elon Musk what time backups {for a specific twitter/X server/db} runs, he wouldn't be able to tell you, because he's the CEO, not the guy doing the actual backup work. 
<br>
Basically, <b>workers</b> (the lowest of the organizational hierarchy) <b>are the most skilled</b>. They are experts at their jobs and in their fields. They usually only ever work in a single position or industry for their entire lives.
<br>
Management are known as "generalists", because they aren't experts or have all the system knowledge, but they have a general understanding of what happens. They usually switch between positions and industries throughout their lives. 
<br> 
As you go up the hierarchy, the more "generalist" people become - basically, the less they know about "how exactly" the company works or produces value.


## Why does the SDM role exist?:
<ol>
<li> <b>Strategic Alignment</b>: SDMs align software development efforts with the overall business strategy. They ensure that projects contribute to the company’s objectives, whether it’s launching a new product, improving efficiency, or enhancing customer experience </li>
<li> <b>Resource Management</b>: SDMs allocate resources. They balance workloads, assign tasks, and manage budgets. By optimizing resource utilization, they enhance productivity and reduce bottlenecks.</li>
<li> <b>Risk Mitigation</b>: SDMs identify risks early in the development process. They address technical challenges, anticipate roadblocks, and create contingency plans. Their proactive approach minimizes project disruptions</li>
<li> <b>Communication Bridge</b>: SDMs facilitate communication between Technical and non-Technical business stakeholders. They translate complex tech jargon into business terms for execs. This ensures everyone is on the same page.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
Basically, SDMs work very closely with the Project Manager to ensure that projects are completed on time, and are accountable, firstly for when projects aren't completed (or budgets evaporate), and secondly, when there are world-ending events like Cyber attacks, or systems have gone down, etc.
<br>
Where the PM focuses specifically on the project and what work needs to be done, the SDM manages who actually does that work and how they work with others to complete the project.

## What does an SDM actually do?
<ol>
<li> <b>Team Coordination</b>: SDMs organize daily stand-up meetings, ensuring everyone is aligned on project status, goals, and blockers. They address team concerns and facilitate collaboration.</li>
<li> <b>Assist with Project Planning</b>: SDMs help to maintain project plans. They help the PM define milestones, allocate resources, and track progress</li>
<li> <b>Stakeholder Communication</b>: SDMs interact with product managers, business owners, and other business stakeholders. They communicate project updates, manage expectations, and address any issues that arise.</li>
<li> <b>Resource Allocation</b>: SDMs allocate work based on team members’ strengths and availability</li>
<li> <b>Performance Reviews</b>: SDMs conduct regular performance evaluations for their team. They provide feedback, set goals, and identify areas for growth</li>
<li> <b>Assist with Long-Term Planning</b>: SDMs assist the Product Manager/Owner with planning team growth, identifying technology trends, and business goals, etc.</li>
</ol>

## Misconceptions about SDMs:
<ol>
<li> <b>"SDMs are the best-of-the-best"</b>: Contrary to this belief, SDMs are usually the <b>least technically-skilled people</b> on the team. Their role is more about orchestrating resources, aligning projects with business goals, and fostering collaboration</li>
<li> <b>"SDMs Are Just Paper-Pushers"</b>: While administrative tasks are part of the job, SDMs do much more. They shape team culture, drive innovation, and ensure projects ultimately succeed. Administrative work is just one aspect of their jobs.</li>
<li> <b>"SDMs Are Always Serious"</b>: Effective SDMs balance seriousness with approachability. They build rapport with their team, listen actively, and create a positive work environment. Humor and empathy are essential.</li>
</ol>
Note that the first point covers technical skill. Ultimately, you can still find work as an SDM, even if you've never been a programmer before, because the job doesn't require intense technical-skill. Generally, those studying in the fields of HR or an MBA will become PMs or SDMs over time.

## Traits of a good SDM:
Every person is different - and there's no way of knowing how someone will act in a specific scenario until you see them in that scenario, but "<b>the good SDM</b>" usually has the following characteristics:

## Downsides of being an SDM:
<ol>
    <li>
        Finding work
        <ul>
            <li>SDMs are hard to replace, so <b>keeping work</b> is super easy, but (it's a double-edged sword) they are also <br>hard to replace</b>, meaning that other companies aren't replacing them often - making new work <b>super hard to find</b>.</li>
            <li>This contrasts the "worker" or Developer, because Devs are always being hired and fired, making work extremely easy for them to find, because companies are constantly on the lookout for new ones.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        People Management Challenges
        <ul>
            <li>Managing people involves handling conflicts, addressing performance issues, and ensuring team morale. It’s rewarding but can also be emotionally draining</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Stressful Deadlines
        <ul>
            <li>Meeting project deadlines, especially during crunch times, can be stressful. SDMs must manage expectations while maintaining quality</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Decision-Making Pressure
        <ul>
            <li>SDMs make critical decisions that impact projects and careers. The weight of these decisions can be stressful</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>



## Conclusion:
Ultimately, being an SDM can be super rewarding, but it balances out by being super challenging as well.
<br>
By being one of those things that are hard to measure accurately, you have your work cut out for you, when trying to lead teams to success.
<br>
Ultimately, Leaders - more than anyone - need to be "team players", and shouldn't rest on their laurels or titles, or allow their egos to go unchecked.
<br>
Remember, that as the SDM, you are the least skilled, least knowledgeable person in your team. 
<br>
"Your" workers are the experts and should be taken seriously and treated with due respect. Without your team, it will be impossible to achieve anything.
