# Contractors:
A Contractor is an IT professional who works on a contractual (non-permanent) basis, rather than as a permanent employee, and is typically hired only for specific projects with specific start/end dates to their contracts.

## Conflicts of Interest:
Most contractors will stretch projects out over a longer term or timeline because of 1 simple and crucial factor: 
<ol><li>Personal interest</li></ol>

Their personal interest (as a person that works for money) will always be to maximise their own financial-gain. 
<br>
They accomplish this by extending the duration it takes them to complete work by hours, days, weeks or even months.
<ul>
    <li>
        This creates a "<b>Conflict of Interest</b>":
        <ul>
            <li>because as <b>workers</b>, their interest is to "<b>Finish work as fast as possible</b>", because they are being paid to finish work ASAP</li>
	    <li>but as <b>humans</b> that work for profit, their interests are to "<b>Finish work as slow as possible</b>", because they make more money.</li>
            <li>This causes a conflict, because they now have to choose between doing "what's best for the company they don't actually work for" and doing "what's best for themselves"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


## How to spot when Contractors are "Conflicted":
Most contractors will start out strong - completing work at an impressive and diligent rate - but then, the <b>"It's out of my hands"-phase</b> sets in.
<ul>
    <li>
        Conversations will start out, positively, as:
        <ul>
            <li><i>"I completed {that} yesterday, I'm working on {this} today, all looking good and on-track!"</i> for the first few weeks or months</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Conversations will then slowly turn into:
        <ul>
	    <li><i>"I spoke to {so and so} and they said I need to speak to {so and so} to fix {some abstract issue they don't explain very well, or overexplain using complex jargon}"</i></li>
            <li><i>"I spoke to {so and so} but they couldn't help, so now I need to speak to {so and so} and possibly chat to {so and so} and that conversation's gonna take another 3 days -> despite no work being done for the last week"</i></li>
	</ul>
    </li>
</ul>
Basically, you'll notice that contractors have "slowed down" a lot, that they're "stalling", or that they're just hitting error-after-error that blocks any major progress for weeks or months on end.

## How to resolve Conflicts of Interest:
This "stalling" behaviour-pattern will continue indefinitely (And may go completely unnoticed for months!), until management intervenes by joining these conversations with <i>"so and so"</i>, forcing the contractor to collaborate with other trusted devs, demanding evidence of work being done, or threatening to end contracts
<br>
After intervention, the contractor will miraculously make leaps and bounds again! Until the next cycle begins and management needs to intervene again.
<br>
Note: Relations with the contractor will sour over time if management intervenes regularly, at which point, projects and quality of work will suffer drastically.

## If all contractors do that, why hire them in the first place??:
Not all contractors are bad, but thereâ€™s a misconception that they are <b>always</b> faster, smarter, and cheaper than in-house developers, which allows the bad ones to take advantage of unsuspecting employers.
<br>
I've worked with a few contractors, and one of them was absolutely outstanding in every project - he's gotten to the point now where the organization will just assign entire projects to him to complete on his own, because of the trust and reputation he's built from his hard work over the years.
<br>
As someone that's been a contractor myself, and who has worked with some really great people over the years, I can safely say that there are many phenomenal contractors out there, but it's important to know which characteristics to look for, and to be aware of which misconceptions there are, before hiring contractors.


## Misconceptions about Contractors:
"<i>Contractors are <b>always</b> faster, smarter, and cheaper than in-house developers, and are more competitive/skilful because they come from super competitive environments</I>".
<br>
This is wholly untrue, and many contractors (or employees, in even the most "competitive" environments | like NASA, for example) are shielded by ["Hidden Incompetence"](https://cyber-finn.github.io/Blog/pages/hidden_incompetence.html) from the organization's reputation or the formal educations they hold.
<br>
In reality, these misconceptions stem from a lack of understanding of technologists and their human-nature (specifically Greed), lack of knowledge of "guaranteed issues that come from outsourced development" and other biases (like trust, or overemphasis on "where someone studied", etc.).

## Issues that come from outsourcing:
<ol>
<li> <b>Limited customization</b> -> vendors (and off-the-shelf tech) usually only allow for minor (or no) customization before you're taken off the upgrade-path. </li>
<li> <b>Costs</b> -> Project planning and analysis costs will skyrocket if not done before outsourcing, so some type of dev staff needs to be kept inhouse.</li>
<li> <b>Quality</b> -> How do you hold contractors accountable for "bad" code, if you don't have anyone that will know if it's good or bad?</li>
<li> <b>Upgrade-paths</b> -> being taken off the upgrade-path results in contractors becoming permanent, higher costs, less system efficiency, no support, off-the-shelf tech becoming stale, etc.</li>
<li> <b>Vendor/Industry niche</b> -> Some niche industries may not be supported by vendors, or you may get subpar service - which would be hard to detect without inhouse developers or inhouse domain experts.</li>
<li> <b>Security concerns</b> -> When the system should be secure and keep data confidential, but development is outsourced, workers could easily build backdoors - or steal/share confidential source code - without anyone knowing. Thereby making attacks like [this one](https://www.bankvault.com/the-swift-hack-why-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-bank-heists-makes-a-good-case-for-bankvault/) or [this one](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c6ppv06e3n8o) possible.</li>
<li> <b>Tech "religious wars"</b> -> The contractors (and even inhouse-devs) will do either whatever is best for them, or what they are comfortable with, not what's best for your company. This results in Conflicts of Interest in Language and Tech selection.</li>
</ol>

## In-house Devs vs Contractors:
For Long-term development or large-scale projects:
<ol>
<li> <b>Cost</b>: in-house wins.</li>
<li> <b>Skill and niche skill</b>: in-house wins, but you may find contractors that specialize in a specific areas.</li>
<li> <b>Performance</b>: in-house wins.</li>
<li> <b>Innovation and customization</b>: in-house wins. Contractors will become in-house devs if they're allowed to, or if you get 'taken off the upgrade path' from too many customizations.</li>
<li> <b>Security</b>: in-house wins.</li>
</ol>

## How do we know if we should hire a contractor then?
Of course, it comes down to business-needs/requirements, but when looking for "<b>the right one</b>", look for contractors that have the following characteristics:
<ol>
<li> Is highly collaborative with Project Managers (PMs) and Business Analysts (BAs), and communicates regularly, clearly and openly (Communication is always King for Project Management)</li>
<li> Explains any issue (complex and simple) in simple, accurate and concise English (This is <b>super</b> important for middle/upper Business management and C-level execs, because they don't care about technical jargon, they want to understand the issue to make the important business decisions - they also don't like feeling "dumb" or having someone act condescending towards them)</li>
<li> Stays in their lane (You don't want a developer-contractor that's spending all their time reviewing another business-unit's code, or drawing up project plans for another team, etc. - because they're wasting your time and money by doing a job they weren't hired for)</li>
<li> Finishes projects as fast as possible (This is <b>super important</b>, and contrasts the conflict-of-interest we discussed previously)</li>
</ol>

## The Smart Contractor:
To explain fully, I'll revise the Conflict of Interest that contractors have:
<br>
<i>The greedy contractor</i>:
* A contractor stretches their work out over a longer period of time to get paid more. 
* For example, Sally gets paid 10cr an hour. Her new project will take her 100 hrs to complete, so she'll get paid 1000cr (10cr x 100hrs) total, 
* BUT if she stretches this project out to 120~140hrs, she'll make between 20~40% more money (1200~1400cr), and she may get pulled into another project at the company over this extended time, so she won't have to find other employment when her contract ends! 
* If she's the only dev on the team/project, and there are no others to hold her accountable, she can stretch the project to 300~400 hrs and make 3~4x the amount of money, because there's nobody around to say "there's no way it takes that long to do, even with that error".
<br>
<i>The smart contractor</i>:
* Finishes their work as fast as possible to build up a reputation of being "the fastest" so that more companies want to hire them. 
* Jamie makes 10cr an hour. Her new project will take 100 hours to complete, she finishes it in 80, thereby only making 800cr - surely this is to her detriment because she made less money? Not at all! 
*  The company she was contracting to now knows that she works faster than anticipated to complete work on time, so she'll be their first candidate for any other projects, or when they seek candidates for permanent-employment.
<br>
Over time, Sally (the greedy contractor) who will develop a bad reputation for being slow or inefficient, will lose work or opportunities because of her pace, thereby making her less money in the long-run.
<br>
Whereas Jamie (the smart contractor) who will develop a good reputation for being the fastest, will be sought after by many companies because she won't miss/extend deadlines. She'll never run out of work or opportunities!
<br>
In this scenario, Jamie is smarter than Sally because she's disciplined and working towards gaining more money in the long-run. Whereas Sally is shooting herself in the foot for immediate financial-gain.
<br>


## Conclusion:
Ultimately, seek a candidate that is both a "Smart Contractor" who displays all the aforementioned attributes of <b>The One</b>, and someone with a high EQ (even if they aren't the most skilled), because EQ plays a very important role within Software Dev Management (As it does in Music - where it also relates to Harmony or Balance). EQ is arguably just as important as technical skill - in some cases (code-red cases, where sirens are blaring and tempers are fuming) it's even more valuable.
<br>
Naturally, you'd want everyone to pull their own weight, but you also don't want know-it-all "Hero Devs" that refuse to collaborate - or, even worse, who shoot others down and create toxic working environments - to run amock. 
<br>
There needs to be some level of balance, which only staff with high EQs can bring to the table.
