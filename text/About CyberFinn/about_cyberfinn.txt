## Notes
Check out [my personal GitHub](https://github.com/Cyber-Finn) for some of the projects I've created and showcase to help others. 
<br> 
This is not a comprehensive list of all the projects I've ever worked on. 
<br>
There are many projects that I'm unable to share because the source code is proprietary and closed-source software, and my duty (as a Software Engineering professional) is to uphold the confidentiality and integrity of the organizations I've worked with.
