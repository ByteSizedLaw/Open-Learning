## Notes
Check out [my personal GitHub](https://github.com/Cyber-Finn) for some of the open-source projects I've created to help others. 
<br> 
This is not a comprehensive list of all the projects I've ever worked on, because many of the projects I have worked on are proprietary and closed-source software, and my duty (as a Software Engineering professional) is to uphold the confidentiality and integrity of the organizations I've worked with.
