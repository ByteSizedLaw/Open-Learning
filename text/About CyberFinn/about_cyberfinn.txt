## Notes
Check out [my personal GitHub](https://github.com/ByteSizedLaw) for some of my open-source projects. 
<br> 
This is not a comprehensive list of all the projects I've ever worked on, because many of the projects I've worked on are proprietary and closed-source software, and my duty (as a Software Engineering professional) is to uphold the confidentiality and integrity of the organizations I work with.
